I need a complete walkthrough for the following programming problem:

**Problem: [Insert Problem Title, e.g., "Two Sum"]**

**Description:**
**[Paste the full problem description here. For example: "Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`."]**

**Input/Output:**
**[Provide the input and output format. For example: "Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9` | Output: `[0,1]`"]**

**Constraints:**
**[List all constraints. For example: "`2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`", "`-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`", "Exactly one solution exists."]**

Please break down the solution in the following manner:

1.  **Naive / Brute-Force Approach**
    * **Intuition:** Explain the most straightforward, simple-to-understand logic.
    * **Algorithm:** Describe the step-by-step process.
    * **Complexity Analysis:** Provide the time and space complexity (e.g., $O(N^2)$, $O(1)$) and explain why.

---

2.  **Improved Approach(es)** (If any exist between naive and optimal)
    * **Bottleneck:** Identify the inefficiency in the previous approach.
    * **Intuition:** Explain the core idea for the improvement (e.g., using sorting, a two-pointer technique, etc.).
    * **Algorithm:** Describe the new, improved steps.
    * **Complexity Analysis:** Provide the new time and space complexity and explain the improvement.

---

3.  **Optimal Approach**
    * **Intuition:** Provide a deep and clear explanation of the key insight that leads to the most efficient solution (e.g., using a hash map, dynamic programming, etc.).
    * **Algorithm:** Detail the steps of the optimal algorithm.
    * **Complexity Analysis:** Provide the final time and space complexity and explain why it's optimal.

---

4.  **C++ Implementation**
    * Provide a clean, well-commented, and complete C++ code for the **optimal solution**. The code should be easy to understand and ready to run.

The main goal is to understand the **thought process** and the journey from a simple idea to a highly efficient algorithm.
